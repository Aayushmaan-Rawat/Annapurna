	<p><h3>"Little by little makes a lot..."</h3>With most urban areas still on a lockdown and businesses resuming operations slowly, multiple communities are yet to find a stable means to provide for their families. Many migrant labourers have been forced to move back to their hometown while a large number of daily wage earners continue to live in the city with no job in hand.
